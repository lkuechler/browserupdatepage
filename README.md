## How to use:

1.  First you have to place a Meta-Tag with the Name "browserUpdate" in your Head area. The content of the Meta-Tag has to be the URL to the Browser-Update-Page. 
2.  Now you only have to place the js-code in your js-file or in a separate one. You can use [this][2] app to generate other Browserfilter
